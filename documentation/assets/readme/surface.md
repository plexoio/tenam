## Surface Plane <a name="surface-plane"></a>

At this juncture, we had no need for wireframes or extensive front-end discussions since the 'Code Institute' readily provided these as noted and tagged on the strategy plane. We worked within the ideas and constraints the provided framework offered.

At the outset, we didn't fully appreciate the significance of adhering to the UX design sequence. However, its effectiveness when properly applied surprised us. Consequently, we can confidently affirm that every plane was vital in arriving at this point (Surface). We recognize that it's during the coding or building phase that we might uncover any gaps or oversights, usually from a `back-end perspective`.

As our project continues to evolve and take shape, we're enthusiastic about the progress and refinements we'll be making.

### Color

- The 'Code Institute' template provided the default colors.
- We updated the background color to `#3498db`.

#### Palette

- Not applicable in this iteration.

### Layout

- The layout for the mockup command-line was pre-provided.
- The command-line presents as a rectangular block situated in the upper right corner of the window.
- The program is displayed within a black internal window, serving as the interaction point for users.
- All aspects outside the command-line remain static.
- A welcome section with relevant information and an input for proceeding is available.
- The login section offers instructions and inputs.
- The Menu section lists features along with an input for navigation.
- We present all information within the same terminal, adding bullet points and bold text as needed for emphasis.
- To create divisions and improve readability, we implemented custom separators.
- Beneath the terminal, we designed an informational section to provide users with a preview of upcoming content.
- As a fun addition, we incorporated a script that displays cryptocurrency prices.

### Fonts

- We replaced the initial Arial default font with `font-family: 'Newsreader', Arial, serif`.

### Images

- There was no need for additional images.

### Order

- The menu list within the command line follows this order:
    - Assets
    - Transactions
    - Data Analysis
    - Taxation
    - Update Tax Value
    - RSS News
    - Refresh
    - Exit
- The order signifies a progression from simple to complex.

### Sequences

- Observance of `progressive disclosure` enabled us to construct a fluid application flow. Users initially encounter the welcome page, which directs them to log in. Post login, users can easily access various features from the Menu.

- The features offer readable content, and users have the option to refresh the window or exit at any point.

As we crafted each section and interaction, we prioritized the economy of design by ensuring the most crucial elements are easily recognizable. The product layouts and interactions revealed numerous patterns. The template provided by the 'Code Institute' allowed for good color contrasts and readability. We also introduced different fonts where necessary.

We designed the site to prevent users from getting lost and consistently showcased value.

**Our design focused on these elements:**

- Repetition
- Contrast
- Proximity
- Alignment
- Accessibility (although not fully achievable)
- Interaction
- Visual Engagement
- Ease of Learning

Our aim was to maintain simplicity by presenting users with fewer choices while emphasizing concrete features and content to realize our MVP goal.

In light of these considerations, the transition of our ideas from the skeleton and surface into code was smooth. The coding process was less complex and more enjoyable, despite the various challenges. This approach saved time, energy, and other resources, leading to reduced human workload, fewer errors, and, ultimately, a superior product - even though we were primarily dealing with a backend project.
