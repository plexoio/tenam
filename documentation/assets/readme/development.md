## Development Process <a name="development"></a> | [#](#index)

We created two `.html` pages, four `.css` files, and six `.js` files, along with a vendor folder, an assets folder, a documentation folder, a vendor folder, and an `.htaccess` file for improved caching. Additionally, we have a `README.md` file.

Throughout the development process, we utilized a user-centered design approach inspired by Jesse James Garrett. We focused on the problem rather than the solution on the `strategy` plane, determining what we wanted to build and preparing our scope.

Based on deadlines and available resources, we determined what we could accomplish on the `scope` plane. We created a minimum viable product (MVP) with some desired functionalities yet to be implemented. This first iteration serves as a presentation to showcase a Web3 financial web app, demonstrating to clients that the financial institution has started building a related product.

We put in extra effort to code better on the `structure` plane, defining content, folder distribution, user interactions, feature locations, and user navigation. We gave form to our ideas on the `skeleton` plane, designing our wireframe using Adobe XD, and deciding what could be improved and what was already fantastic.

We established colors, fonts, elements, and content on the `surface` plane, defining everything that users could see in the system. Each plane is related to the others, and the surface is the final projection of our work.

We faced several challenges during the planning, documentation, and coding processes, but with patience and perseverance, we found a solution for each one.

In future iterations, we plan to develop the `index` and `contact` pages further, particularly the `index` with the `Metamask Login`.

We are satisfied with our first iteration of tenam, as users learn about this emerging technology and the financial institution informs them about upcoming developments. Radical changes are not always positive, so building and deploying this project was an excellent idea.


## Deployment Process <a name="deployment"></a> | [#](#index)

We used Visual Studio, Git Bash, and GitHub for coding and version control, enabling us to deploy our product quickly once it was completed.

- We made sure to have secure backups of the site, not relying solely on the GitHub repository but also creating structured backups on external hard disks.

- We ensured from the outset that we were using industry-standard ways of structuring our directory and naming our files.

- We updated all directory references in the code, changing them from absolute to relative directories to ensure interoperability during deployment

- We optimized images and code using tools such as W3C, a screen reader, and GT-matrix, testing the site on various devices.

- After confirming that the README.md was up to date, we opened GitHub Pages for our product. The setup process was straightforward:

1. Go to your repository.
2. Click on the settings button.
3. Go to the left navbar and select `Code and automation`.
4. Click on `Pages`.
5. Select `deploy from a branch`.
6. Choose `Branch` and then `/root`, and click on `Save`.
7. Wait for 1 to 5 minutes, then refresh your page.
8. On top of that section, you will see the link to your GitHub Pages.

In this way, we were able to deploy our project successfully with no major issues. For more information, please refer to the other sections and subsections of this README.md file.

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), was used for the following queries:

1. Used for quick general consulting.
2. Used to convert a HTML code to a Markdown table for the README.md file. As seen from our extended self-coded versions: [strategy-table](https://github.com/plexoio/tenam/blob/main/documentation/extended-versions/strategy-table.html).
3. Copywriting and proofreading.
4. Used to validate HTML and styling codes.
5. Used to confirm whether or not my code snippet is correct after hours of self-debugging on `Javascript`.

**Note:** ChatGPT has given some false answers during some queries. We always need to question its answers.
