- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), was used for the following queries:

1. Used for quick general consulting.
2. Used to convert a HTML code to a Markdown table for the README.md file. As seen from our extended self-coded versions: [strategy-table](https://github.com/plexoio/tenam/blob/main/documentation/extended-versions/strategy-table.html).
3. Copywriting and proofreading.
4. Used to validate HTML and styling codes.
5. Used to confirm whether or not my code snippet is correct after hours of self-debugging on `Javascript`.

**Note:** ChatGPT has given some false answers during some queries. We always need to question its answers.
