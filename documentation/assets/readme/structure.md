## Structure Plane <a name="structure-plane"></a> | [#](#index)

This project is designed for everyone, although the level of difficulty may primarily cater to users with `accessibility` issues. The entire operation runs on a command-line interface that is highly user-friendly and straightforward, making it easy to understand the concept and actual functionalities.

In terms of navigation, we opted not to compile a list of rules as it wouldn't serve our project's purpose. Instead, users will find a `Menu section` as soon as they log in. This design ensures that users can effortlessly navigate, identify their current location within the application, comprehend the available actions, and determine their potential next steps.

Our `Gitmind` mind maps vividly illustrate the different state changes, from the welcome page to the various features of the MVP app.

As always, we have `prioritized` consistency, predictability, learnability, visibility, and feedback to ensure a positive user experience.

For more details on our `Interactive Experience Design (IXD)` for the `Tenam Prototype/Demo Project`, please refer to the attached mind map.

In navigating the site, we aim to promote efficent users' decision-making by providing familiar vocabulary and clear instructions. We assure users that they can maximize the potential of our MVP.

We recognize that a command-line interface can pose challenges for some users. However, in our case, we've made every effort to ensure that all interactions are easy to understand and straightforward.

It's crucial to consider both IXD (Interaction Experience Design) and IAD (Information Architecture Design) to achieve a comprehensive mental model of the product.

For more detailed insights into our `Information Architecture Design (IAD)` for the `Tenam Prototype/Demo Project`, please refer to the attached mind map.

In this initial iteration, we have a clear understanding of our desires, requirements, and what is beneficial for us. The IXD and IAD supplied us with the essential components to work with, empowering us to reach our objectives with this remarkable project. We can now proceed to the `Skeleton plane` and start building from this point forward.
