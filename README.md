# Tenam - A Crypto Portfolio Tracker

Tenam is a comprehensive `cryptocurrency portfolio tracker`. This dynamic tool consolidates all your crypto investments into a single interface, negating the need to individually access each platform. 

- For the present phase, we're utilizing `static data` from gspread, acknowledging the open and sensitive nature of project delivery on GitHub.

Tenam emphasizes seamless portfolio access, rich statistical analysis, and timely crypto market updates with a single click. However, our vision extends beyond merely displaying your crypto amounts and their corresponding dollar values. We're committed to creating an `investment-focused experience` for our users. This includes accounting for country-specific tax implications linked to cryptocurrency liquidations. 

- Tenam includes as well a transaction sheet that diligently records all deposits and withdrawals.

Tenam is equipped with robust features like current `price comparisons` against portfolio values, coin filtering (future implementation), future and historical value analysis. This empowers you with insightful retrospection `past values` and foresight `future values` regarding your holdings.

- In this iteration, all can be accessed only through a `command-line interface`.

For future implementations, we aim to establish direct connections with leading cryptocurrency exchanges such as `Binance` and `Coinbase` for real-time portfolio management. 

- **DISCLAIMER:** While Tenam is designed to be a valuable tool for managing your cryptocurrency investments, it should not serve as a substitute for professional financial advice. It's essential to conduct your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor prior to making any investment decisions.

Please note that this current iteration is not available for public deployment; **it is intended solely for learning and demonstration purposes** even though is ready for use.
