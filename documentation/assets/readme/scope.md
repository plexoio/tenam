## Scope Plane <a name="scope-plane"></a>

Python posed a significant challenge, particularly due to the mental strain that the last two projects exerted. The timeframes were exceedingly short, leaving us with hardly any room to breathe or fully assimilate the information. However, we remained steadfast in our belief in simplicity while aiming to deliver a project that was not only demonstrative but also `fully functional`. Our strategy allowed us to visualize what we could achieve given the constraints of time, technology, and resources.

- For this iteration, we decided to incorporate features and functionalities under the following conditions and goals:


|Condition|Iteration|Goals|
|---|---|---|
|Limited use|Data Analysis<br>Transaction History<br>RSS News<br>Taxation and Tax Update|Culture acquisition|
|Simple design|Portfolio Display<br>Menu<br>Login<br>Welcome<br>Add, Delete, Update|Tech Showcase|
|Low leading rates<br>& Non-functional| RSS News|Long-term Investment<br>& Future Implementation|


- As we can observe, the first items on our list are the most achievable. We plan to draft the starting points for those tagged as future implementation to ensure clarity, enhance user experience, and effectively communicate our message.

- The entire development process is slated to span five days, with the initial design for future implementation not exceeding one day.

- In this iteration, our focus is on pragmatism to meet the requirements of both the Code Institute and the project at hand.

- We have thoroughly analyzed crucial elements at every stage of our research for `Useful, Sellable, Buildable` â€“ taking into account objectives, functional and non-functional requirements, business rules, features for future implementation, and much more.

As per our User Story table, users have the ability to:

**Note:** In this context, `subject` refers to a user, prospect, or stakeholder.

### User Story

| Scenario                                      | Solution                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User seeks a crypto portfolio tracker         | User finds the command-line interface                                                  |
| User realizes there isn't real connection yet    | User understands this is an MVP iteration for demonstration purposes                   |
| User wants to learn more about the app        | User discovers the app's functionality by logging in and exploring                      |
| User wants to test each feature               | User finds the menu section presenting all essential entry points                      |
| User wants to know more about Blockchain      | User finds an RSS functionality designed for this purpose                               |

Consequently, we have aligned our Scope with the findings derived from our research in the `Strategy plane`. It is evident at this point that the intention is to implement a `Minimum Viable Product (MVP)` iteration. This will effectively aid us in establishing the foundations for our next stage, `Structure`.
