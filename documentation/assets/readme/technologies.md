## Technologies Utilized <a name="technologies"></a> | [#](#index)

Every project demands the adoption of standard procedures and a diverse range of crucial tools, and ours was no different.

We made use of the following technologies throughout the entire project lifespan:

### Development Tools
- **[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/plexoio)**: Our primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) enhanced with in-house extensions like auto-save.
- **Visual Studio Code desktop**: A secondary tool for coding, enriched with numerous extensions such as auto-save, boilerplates, markdown and HTML preview, HTML auto-indentation, and JavaScript auto-indentation, among others.
- **[Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/p3-template)**: Leveraged to deploy our Python project.
- **[Heroku](https://heroku.com/)**: To deploy our final project.
- **[PEP8 CI Python Linter by Code Institute](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)**: To comply with Python coding standards.
- **[Python Tutur](https://pythontutor.com/)**: For debugging and to understand how the code works.
- **[Slack Community](https://slack.com/)**: Community created by Code Institute for coding issues and course management.
- **[Calendly](https://calendly.com/)**: To control mentor's appointments
-**[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)**: To improve English content
- **Google Developer Tools**: Employed for comprehensive testing and debugging.
- **GitHub**: Used as the foundation for our repositories and version control.
- **Git Bash**: An essential tool for version control and project management.
- **[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)**: Served as a reservoir of knowledge and information for the construction of the entire project.

### Design Elements
- **[Crypto Widget](https://www.cryptohopper.com/)**: Incorporated in the footer section.
- **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**: Utilized to inject personality into the website.
- **[Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/)**: Used to select the project's primary color palette.
- **[Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)**: Used to create initial mockups across various screen sizes.
- **PowerPoint**: Deployed for the creation of table graphics on the Strategy Plane.
- **[Gitmind](https://gitmind.com/)**: Used for Mind map creation.
- **[Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif)**: Used to convert MP4 files to GIF format.
- **[Freeconvert](https://www.freeconvert.com/gif-compressor)**: Employed for compressing GIF images.
- **[Wechat](https://www.wechat.com/)**: A versatile Chinese desktop and mobile app used for quick screenshots, editing, and cropping.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- **[ChatGPT-4](https://chat.openai.com/chat)**: Used for consultation, copywriting, proofreading, and assistance with various routine tasks:

  - We relied heavily on GPT4 for this iteration, using it as a tutor or mentor when complexities arose. It was instrumental in identifying various modules and libraries and explaining their use. 

  - It is crucial to mention that we maintained responsibility during all interactions with the AI. Instead of asking the AI to solve problems for us, we sought examples of problem-solving approaches. When faced with unclear responses, we asked GPT4 to clarify specific elements to enhance our understanding.

  - The project's author (myself) hosts a Spanish-language podcast where discussions around the ethics and morality of Blockchain and AI technology take place. This project provided an opportunity to apply all that knowledge.
