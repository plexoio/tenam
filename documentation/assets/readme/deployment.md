## Deployment Process

We used Visual Studio, Git Bash, and GitHub for coding and version control, enabling us to deploy our product quickly once it was completed.

- We made sure to have secure backups of the site, not relying solely on the GitHub repository but also creating structured backups on external hard disks.

- We ensured from the outset that we were using industry-standard ways of structuring our directory and naming our files.

- We updated all directory references in the code, changing them from absolute to relative directories to ensure interoperability during deployment

- We optimized images and code using tools such as W3C, a screen reader, and GT-matrix, testing the site on various devices.

- After confirming that the README.md was up to date, we opened GitHub Pages for our product. The setup process was straightforward:

1. Go to your repository.
2. Click on the settings button.
3. Go to the left navbar and select `Code and automation`.
4. Click on `Pages`.
5. Select `deploy from a branch`.
6. Choose `Branch` and then `/root`, and click on `Save`.
7. Wait for 1 to 5 minutes, then refresh your page.
8. On top of that section, you will see the link to your GitHub Pages.

In this way, we were able to deploy our project successfully with no major issues. For more information, please refer to the other sections and subsections of this README.md file.
