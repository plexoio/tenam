## Structure Plane

This project is designed for everyone, although the level of difficulty may primarily cater to users with `accessibility` issues. The entire operation runs on a command-line interface that is highly user-friendly and straightforward, making it easy to understand our concept and actual functionalities.

In terms of navigation, we opted not to compile a list of rules as it wouldn't serve our project's purpose. Instead, users will find a `Menu section` after the welcoming section. This design ensures that users can effortlessly navigate, identify their current location within the application, comprehend the available actions, and determine their potential next steps.

- Our `Gitmind` mind maps vividly illustrate the different state changes, from the welcome page to the various features of the MVP app.

- As always, we have `prioritized` consistency, predictability, learnability, visibility, and feedback to ensure a positive user experience.

For more details on our `Interactive Experience Design (IXD)` for the `Tenam Prototype/Demo Project`, please refer to the attached mind map.

In navigating the site, we aim to promote efficent users' `decision-making` by providing familiar vocabulary and clear instructions. We assure users that they can maximize the potential of our MVP.

We recognize that a command-line interface can pose challenges for some users. However, in our case, we've made every effort to ensure that all interactions are easy to understand and straightforward.

- It's crucial to consider both IXD (Interaction Experience Design) and IAD (Information Architecture Design) to achieve a comprehensive mental model of the product.

For more detailed insights into our `Information Architecture Design (IAD)` for the `Tenam Prototype/Demo Project`, please refer to the attached mind map.

In this initial iteration, we have a clear understanding of our desires, requirements, and what is beneficial for us. The `IXD` and `IAD` supplied us with the essential components to work with, empowering us to reach our objectives with this remarkable project. We can now proceed to the `Skeleton plane` and start building from this point forward.
